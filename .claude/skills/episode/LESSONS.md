# Lessons

Each rule in SKILL.md, with the measurement that made it. When a new failure
teaches something, add it here with its evidence, then put the rule in
SKILL.md.

## Process

- **Gate the plan through the take-prompt battery before audio or pictures.**
  ep06 paid for three picture stages by skipping it. ep09 skipped it too, and
  seven over-long prompts and four banned props surfaced only at the takes
  stage (2026-09-22).
- **Build only what the episode needs.** References are made just in time, per
  episode. There are no bulk renders across the book.
- **The owner directs; do it with the tools.** When he says upload, it goes
  public. Never hand him a form or a task.
- **Do not stop until the deliverable is done.** Decide, go, and correct after
  his feedback.
- **A fix that changes nothing is not a fix.** Measure the artefact, not the
  tests. Green unit tests passed twice today on fixtures that did not match
  the real files: a shot keyed `at` where real placed shots use
  `t_start`/`t_end`, and a Setup built without its required fields.

## Cast

- **Describe the cast from its rows, never from memory.** ep07 shipped four
  characters that contradicted their rows. In ep09 all four newly written
  descriptions contradicted theirs; one milkman had sandy side-whiskers where
  his row gives a chestnut walrus moustache. `cast_refs.tag` now enforces it.
- **The words follow the picture when the book is silent.** Snippy's prompt
  asked for a moustache and the sheet came back clean-shaven. The picture is
  what gets staged.
- **Extraction rows can invent.** Two chapter-9 wardrobes gave gloves where
  the book gives bare hands, and the take lint refused four prompts.
- **Unique silhouettes.** Every character, walk-ons too, gets a colour, a dress
  and a hairline no one else in the episode has.
- **Staging is by declared cast.** Matching names by the last word of a display
  name staged "the neighbour's wife" for "the narrator's wife", and "the
  newspaper boy" for any boy, in six published takes.
- **One chapter's clothes at a time.** `refs.json` is rewritten per episode.
  Rows stamped for another chapter are refused.

## Places

- **The hour comes from the reference, never the words.** This was measured
  twice on ep05.
- **The defining state goes first in a place's prompt.** The lawn's fire sat
  about 55 words in and was not drawn; redrawn with "ON FIRE" first, it was.
- **One picture per place per episode, chosen by the setup** (owner,
  2026-09-18). Two views of one observatory in one episode became two rooms.
- **Never rewrite the book's location rows for one episode.** Doing it for ep09
  moved ep03-ep08's Horsell Common into daylight. `Setup.view` is the choice.
- **Write cells from the drawn picture.** Cells written before drawing
  contradicted it: the cedar was on the wrong side, the arch opening in the
  wrong place.
- **Say a cell at the size of its shot** (G-SCALE). Wide cells in a close-up
  drew the place without the man; wide cells in a newspaper insert drew the
  whole platform.

## Grids and panels

- **Qwen-Image: 1-3 references.** Identity goes first and the place last. Only
  the cast of the shots a grid owns goes in.
- **An unused LoadImage slot is a doll.** ComfyUI's example.png reached the
  encoder in every grid until `stage_only`.
- **Staging decides who appears, not words.** "A picture of the place alone"
  did not keep the only staged sheet out. Split the grid so a sheet goes only
  with its own shots.
- **The grid negative prompt is inert at CFG 1.0.** ComfyUI skips the
  unconditional branch, so every "no beard, no duplicates" there did nothing.
- **A fixed crop trim leaves gutters.** Measure the seam off (`seam_box`).

## Takes

- **H3 obeys direction, not amount.** 0 of 16 amounts were obeyed. Point every
  move at something already in the cell.
- **A take that froze after its own length changed wants its length back.**
  ep08 T16 went 51% frozen, then 75% on a fresh seed, then 10% with its coda
  restored.
- **A silent gap belongs to the silent shot inside it.** Trimming neighbours'
  codas closed the number and froze a take.
- **Mux lag follows length.** Shorten the take; a new seed does not help.
- **No last-frame pin.** It freezes or dissolves the segment.
- **No composed frame zero from sheets.** A panel cut from a multi-shot grid is
  allowed.

## DQ

- **A gate that measured nothing has passed nothing.** "0/0 panels pass" read
  exactly like a clean run.
- **Thresholds carry the world they were fitted in.** Ink was fitted on night
  episodes and failed 11 clean daylight panels; the night control was picked by
  any "dark" in the prose.
- **Read whole words.** "compartment" was `men` and "surface" was a face. With
  no word boundaries the people check was off on about 80% of shots.
- **A crowd is declared, never inferred.**
- **A face counts at detector confidence 0.8 or more.** Smoke and steam scored
  up to 0.78; real faces scored 0.86 and above.
- **Look at what went public.** Four identical shopmen and a "NEWSPAPER BOY"
  headline passed every gate in ep08. The content gate now catches the first;
  OCR is needed for the second.
