# Lessons

Each rule in SKILL.md, with the measurement that made it. When a new failure
teaches something, add it here with its evidence, then put the rule in
SKILL.md.

## Process

- **Gate the plan through the take-prompt battery before audio or pictures.**
  ep06 paid for three picture stages by skipping it. ep09 skipped it too, and
  seven over-long prompts and four banned props surfaced only at the takes
  stage (2026-09-22).
- **Build only what the episode needs.** References are made just in time, per
  episode. There are no bulk renders across the book.
- **The owner directs; do it with the tools.** When he says upload, it goes
  public. Never hand him a form or a task.
- **Do not stop until the deliverable is done.** Decide, go, and correct after
  his feedback.
- **A fix that changes nothing is not a fix.** Measure the artefact, not the
  tests. Green unit tests passed twice today on fixtures that did not match
  the real files: a shot keyed `at` where real placed shots use
  `t_start`/`t_end`, and a Setup built without its required fields.

- **Look at every contact sheet and every take strip; the gates do not see
  everything.** ep09's panel contact sheet showed a white gutter 97 px inside
  shot 14's edge, the narrator in his boater AND holding a hat (shots 11, 20),
  and an insert that was the place picture handed back; both panel gates
  passed all three. The take strips showed T02's fence sliding through the
  neighbour, which take_dq passed at 92.6 (2026-09-23).
- **A plan script writes plan.json only through `episode_home.write_plan`.**
  All 16 wrote unchecked; "nods slowly" replaced a good plan on disk and
  grids.py was the first to fail (2026-09-23).
- **Ten read-only audit agents found what a day of building had not**: the
  grid dressed every ep09 character from chapter 6 (a hard-coded chapter the
  lead had read past), a common-noun name that staged a 13-year-old's sheet
  for a stranger, and a "make public" step that checked nothing. Audit with
  fresh eyes after a heavy build (2026-09-23).

## Cast

- **Describe the cast from its rows, never from memory.** ep07 shipped four
  characters that contradicted their rows. In ep09 all four newly written
  descriptions contradicted theirs; one milkman had sandy side-whiskers where
  his row gives a chestnut walrus moustache. `cast_refs.tag` now enforces it.
- **The words follow the picture when the book is silent.** Snippy's prompt
  asked for a moustache and the sheet came back clean-shaven. The picture is
  what gets staged.
- **Extraction rows can invent.** Two chapter-9 wardrobes gave gloves where
  the book gives bare hands, and the take lint refused four prompts.
- **Unique silhouettes.** Every character, walk-ons too, gets a colour, a dress
  and a hairline no one else in the episode has.
- **Staging is by declared cast.** Matching names by the last word of a display
  name staged "the neighbour's wife" for "the narrator's wife", and "the
  newspaper boy" for any boy, in six published takes.
- **One chapter's clothes at a time.** `refs.json` is rewritten per episode.
  Rows stamped for another chapter are refused.

- **Declared extras are the plan's claim; take the number from the book.**
  ep09 declared 6 for "a bevy of hussars ... two of them dismounted"; the
  take drew six riders and the two on foot, and the content gate failed it
  at 7 for 6. Declared 8 (2026-09-23).
- **A person with a hat in his hand must be called "bareheaded".** Tagged
  with the boater and holding it, the narrator was drawn with two (ep09 11,
  20). G-HAT refuses the clash in the plan now.
- **A common-noun name binds only in a definite phrase.** "the dismounted
  hussar" binds; "serge hussar jacket" and "a boy of sixteen" do not; "the
  narrator's wife" is the wife, not the narrator (2026-09-23).

## Places

- **The hour comes from the reference, never the words.** This was measured
  twice on ep05.
- **The defining state goes first in a place's prompt.** The lawn's fire sat
  about 55 words in and was not drawn; redrawn with "ON FIRE" first, it was.
- **One picture per place per episode, chosen by the setup** (owner,
  2026-09-18). Two views of one observatory in one episode became two rooms.
- **Never rewrite the book's location rows for one episode.** Doing it for ep09
  moved ep03-ep08's Horsell Common into daylight. `Setup.view` is the choice.
- **Write cells from the drawn picture.** Cells written before drawing
  contradicted it: the cedar was on the wrong side, the arch opening in the
  wrong place.
- **Say a cell at the size of its shot** (G-SCALE). Wide cells in a close-up
  drew the place without the man; wide cells in a newspaper insert drew the
  whole platform.

## Grids and panels

- **Qwen-Image: 1-3 references.** Identity goes first and the place last. Only
  the cast of the shots a grid owns goes in.
- **An unused LoadImage slot is a doll.** ComfyUI's example.png reached the
  encoder in every grid until `stage_only`.
- **Staging decides who appears, not words.** "A picture of the place alone"
  did not keep the only staged sheet out. Split the grid so a sheet goes only
  with its own shots.
- **The grid negative prompt is inert at CFG 1.0.** ComfyUI skips the
  unconditional branch, so every "no beard, no duplicates" there did nothing.
- **A fixed crop trim leaves gutters.** Measure the seam off (`seam_box`).

- **The grid prompt is v2: subject first, garments bound whole.** Same seeds on
  ep09: v1 cloned both leads at tea and drew the lawn's insert as a copy of its
  wide; v2 did neither. The clothing half of that A/B was judged against the
  wrong chapter (see docs/calibration/grid_prompt_ab.md, correction).
- **Lay grids out by shot size; hold head counts in a 1x1.** A mixed 2x2 drew
  a medium close as a full figure; eight seeds of a 2x2 drew 7-14 hussars
  where every 1x1 drew the declared count.
- **A grid is stale when what it would be drawn from changes** -- the prompt
  text and every staged picture's bytes -- not only its plan fields. The
  chapter-6 wardrobe could never have read as stale under the old check.
- **Crop a shaved panel square.** Resizing a 895x992 crop to a square
  stretched shot 14 11% into H3.

## Takes

- **H3 obeys direction, not amount.** 0 of 16 amounts were obeyed. Point every
  move at something already in the cell.
- **A take that froze after its own length changed wants its length back.**
  ep08 T16 went 51% frozen, then 75% on a fresh seed, then 10% with its coda
  restored.
- **A silent gap belongs to the silent shot inside it.** Trimming neighbours'
  codas closed the number and froze a take.
- **Mux lag follows length.** Shorten the take; a new seed does not help.
- **No last-frame pin.** It freezes or dissolves the segment.
- **No composed frame zero from sheets.** A panel cut from a multi-shot grid is
  allowed.

- **Aim every move at what the cell already holds (G-AIM).** In ep09's retake
  round 1, shots 14, 15 and 18 repeated their faults on fresh seeds: a tilt
  past the cell invented a lawn, a tilt from tiles the cell lacks opened
  elsewhere, a pan to an undrawn bridge invented a street.
- **A fault that repeats on a fresh seed is the plan's, not the seed's.**
- **Never truck sideways across a person anchored to the set (G-ANCHOR).** H3
  keeps the person where the cell put them and slides the scenery through
  them: ep09 T02, the neighbour leaning on the fence (owner: "ai slop, dq
  missed it"); also T10, ep07 T13, ep08 T14. Push in, crane or hold.
- **The take prompt says the place once too often.** T15, a 3-second rubble
  insert, opened 0.5 s on the burning lawn its prompt named three times.

## DQ

- **A gate that measured nothing has passed nothing.** "0/0 panels pass" read
  exactly like a clean run.
- **Thresholds carry the world they were fitted in.** Ink was fitted on night
  episodes and failed 11 clean daylight panels; the night control was picked by
  any "dark" in the prose.
- **Read whole words.** "compartment" was `men` and "surface" was a face. With
  no word boundaries the people check was off on about 80% of shots.
- **A crowd is declared, never inferred.**
- **A face counts at detector confidence 0.8 or more.** Smoke and steam scored
  up to 0.78; real faces scored 0.86 and above.
- **Look at what went public.** Four identical shopmen and a "NEWSPAPER BOY"
  headline passed every gate in ep08. The content gate now catches the first;
  OCR is needed for the second.
- **`cut` reads brightness; a switch of picture is `jump`.** T15's second
  attempt changed pictures at cut 26.5 and passed at 74; the signature jump
  reads 0.16 against 0.83+ on every accepted take.
- **Judge a take by what is fixed in the world, not only by the frame.**
  `held` compares the face's travel with the scenery's: T02 1.01 over 1055 px
  of fence. Whether a held subject is a fault is the plan's call.
- **Calibrate before you wall.** A darkness wall would have failed 39 of 127
  accepted takes, and layout correlation 19 accepted pairs; neither was built.
